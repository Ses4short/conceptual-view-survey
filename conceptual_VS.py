This short survey aims to understand how users interpret explanations generated from two types of conceptual views derived from Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models.

üìå **Note:** Both explanations lead to the same model prediction. Your task is to judge how understandable the explanation itself is ‚Äî not the predicted outcome.

Your responses are anonymous and will only be used for research purposes.
